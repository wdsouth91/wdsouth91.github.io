How in the world is it already May? I swear every time I turn around it's already been several weeks and I haven't accomplished much! Man, anyway, I'm hoping that this new website/blog sticks because I'm tired of all the other social blogging platforms. (Except for my beloved PlasmaTrap, it can do no wrong) Everyone seems so intent on making everything suck for writers. I suppose it's only a matter of time before we end up back on the early days of the internet. I wonder if there's a law of psychology or technology that holds true that the internet will return to its beginnings the long way around. 

I am going to be posting more fiction here too, and sharing other documents and things like that. I think I'll even serialize some fiction here too, once I get things set up and fluffed up a lot better. I'm still not 100% on how I have things organized here, but fortunately this is just as easy as moving text files around so I can always make things look and flow differently as I need to. I just wish there was some better ways to create menus but at the same time, I really like the KISS philosophy in motion here. I don't need anything super fancy to show you text, right? 

Stay well!
