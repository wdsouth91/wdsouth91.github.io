Man! It has been a busy week for me. One of the busiest times of year for us at work and I've been doing what I can to keep up with my editing and writing projects. I don't often take on freelance editing work but I always do find it to be a rewarding and enriching experience when I do. 

While progress on my *Space Horror Audio Fiction* might have slowed, some of my other projects have begun to grow. I didn't think I'd be returning to attempting an urban fantasy again any time soon but uh, here we are. It's always fun to try to convince the muse what you want to work on, isn't it? 

Anyway, I have also been working on my short fiction pieces which should start getting published here and on the fediverse soonishly, once I catch up to myself from the stress of this week and get things all polished up. Well, that's all I have for right now. Here's hoping I can get things on track and keep it there soon. Got big plans for this summer, and for the first time in years, I actually feel like keeping up with them.
